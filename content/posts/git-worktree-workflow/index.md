### **Prelude:** Scientist in a data labyrinth
As experimental neuroscientist in training, I often find myself caught between two worlds: the messy, exploratory world of data analysis where I try to make sense of the experimental data, often relying on a trial-and-error strategy, and the aspired structured, reproducible world of scientific publication where hopefully every figure will be exactly reproducible. Between these worlds lies a labyrinth of processing pipelines, half-written scripts, and the ever-present risk of breaking the working analysis while trying to improve it. The wandering in the labyrinth is rarely straight-forward -- one is expected to hit many dead ends and discover other interesting distractions before finding the actual treasure -- the key results that hopefully lead to a scientific publication or other forms of consolidated knowledge piece. I try to illustrate this metaphoric labyrinth that is my non-metaphoric reality in a diagram:

So how do I navigate this mess? Ideally, I can (1) keep track of all my all tiny and big successes and failures, (2) do so without blowing up the project with unnecessary redundancy, (3) reuse or combine elements of (pre-)processing and analysis in different ways, (4) and (re-)visit and abandon or recover any state at any given time. In short, I want to experiment freely and safely in the space that is spanned by the data and the available (meaningful) manipulations without compromising reproducibility or creating unnecessary overheads.

### **Introduction:** Better modular than regular
A useful concept that lights my way (though how enlighted I am not sure am I) is [YODA's Organigram on Data Analysis](https://github.com/myyoda/myyoda) that captures the most key principle of managing reproducible complex scientific workflow involving digital objects: **modularity**. 

The first level of modularity is fairly straight-forward: each component of the workflow should be a stand-alone module on its own (**-> reusable, combinable**), e.g. raw data, derived data, code, containers. In the diagram above each node is a module as such. Yes, the *scientist* is also a stand-alone module (so I hope :D). To achieve this level of modularity, it is enough to create a repository/dataset for each component using a version control system such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (only for code or other small files) or [DataLad](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/index.html). Datalad is built on Git and [Git-Annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com) and can handle both code and data (or basically anything you care about).

The second level of modularity is less obvious, but the actually key for achieving reproducible workflows and not just a static collection of version-controlled data: how to move from one state to another or in other words, how all but raw data come into existence (**-> provenance-tracking**) including that figure you presented in the last lab meeting back in January and can't find the code to reproduce it (ha, gotcha!). In the diagram this is represented by the directed edges with the respective parent and child. Take the connection *Data -> Processing A*, a module in YODA sense is the mapping from raw data (inputs) to processed data (outputs) with the processing pipeline A (code). In practice, we now link two or more submodules/subdatasets together in a functional module aka superdataset (**-> hierachical**). But not just that, we can now version-control the manipulations on data, as well, using the [datalad (containers-)](https://docs.datalad.org/projects/container/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-containers-run.html) [run](https://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-run.html#datalad-run) command that ensures full provenance tracking. At this level of modularity, we likely quickly run into dataset-nesting since any functional module can also be the input to another functional module downstream as illustrated in the diagram, e.g. *processed data* after manipulation *A* is provided to *Analysis X* and *Analysis Y* as inputs. Per modularity principle, this requires the installation of *Processing A* as a subdataset inside *Analysis X/Y*. A person working only on *Analysis X/Y* will see *Processing A* only once, but a person working on both *Processing A* and *Analysis X/Y* will see *Processing A* twice -- because once per functional module! How to avoid unnecessary overheads here? Keep *Processing A* as the canonical instance in the functional module *Data -> Processing A*, and [install an ephemeral instance](https://docs.datalad.org/en/stable/generated/man/datalad-install.html) of it as subdataset in *Processing A -> Analysis X/Y*. This way, both instances share the same annex content via symlinks (**-> no redundancy**). Pretty smart, right?

Is there a third level of modularity? I would argue yes! If the first level is components (raw data, code, etc.) and the second is provenance (tracking how components transform into one another), then the third level is orchestration - how we safely and efficiently execute these transformations, especially when they need to happen in parallel, in isolation, or across different environments. In our labyrinth metaphor, we now have:
1. Nodes = **Components** (data, code, containers)
2. Nodes + Edges = **Provenance** (how nodes transform)
3. Paths = **Execution strategies** (how we navigate the graph)

This third level addresses questions like:
- How do I run 100 analyses in parallel? -> see this heavyweight but beautiful [fairly-big-processing-workflow](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/fairly-big-processing-workflow)
- How do I ensure the same analysis runs identically on my laptop, the cluster, and in 6 months where some packages might have updated? -> @yarikoptic can you add a reference for containers here?
- How do I explore multiple states simultaneously without them interfering with each other, and at no cost, so that the expedition can be afforded daily?

This blog post is all about the third question. Before we dig in, have you noticed that something is missing from my wishlist? Let's briefly return to the metaphoric labyrinth that in reality is a decision tree: We've got multiple variants on each level, i.e. two ways of (pre-)processing, three ways of analyzing, and four potential outcomes. In the very end, after a long, exhaustive, and hopefully successful wandering we only need to keep and reproduce the path *Data -> Processing B -> Analysis Z -> Publication* (colored in *Morning Glacier*). Do we really want to keep all the less fruitful attempts (colored in *Rosy Horizon*), especially if they are actually derived from each other, and not completely new stuff? Very good question! After hitting the first *Dead End*, we might not *backtrack* (dashed lines colored in *Sagebrush Drift*) to *Processing A*, but to *Analysis X* instead, and derive *Analysis Y* from it. We might also derive *Analysis Z* from *Analysis Y*, and *Processing B* from *Processing A*. What do we end up with? Classical versioning of the same thing! So instead of investing stand-alone modules in these variants and blowing up our project with redundancy, we can simply leave them in the repo history and let Git manage them (**-> time-traveling**). For a linear history we can use [git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) to label the specific states/commits for later retrieval. If we decide to continue developing from there in a divergent fashion at a later time, we can create a specific branch and develop there. For our diagram above, all components at the same level can indeed be combined into one module, with the node colored in *Morning Glacier* being the present (or in my case the future since I haven't found the treasure yet) or the final state, and all nodes colored in *Rosy Horizon* being the past (or in my case the present since I'm still in the labyrinth) or the (git) history. Now, that we have enabled time-traveling in our project, which means I'm free to checkout any state at any time, we can tackle the real challenge: how do we visit multiple states simultaneously (**-> parallel universes** aka [Everything Everywhere All At Once](https://www.imdb.com/de/title/tt6710474/))?

### **Origin Story:** When YODA's wisdom grows on trees
It all started at the recent [Distribits](https://www.distribits.live/events/2025-distribits/) meeting, when [Yarik](https://github.com/yarikoptic) introduced the [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to me upon my question: "How can I continue working on my dataset when I'm running a processing script that takes a long while?". To ensure reproducibility, [`datalad run`](https://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-run.html) command requires the datasets to be clean. Executing a series of `datalad run`commands effectively blocks me from working on any of the involved components. A git worktree is a built-in Git feature that allows the creation of multiple, separate working directories from a single Git repository. Each worktree is linked to a specific branch or commit, meaning one can check out and work on different branches simultaneously without affecting the others. The cherry on the top: it provides isolation without duplication. All worktrees share the same core repository history and data. It sounds all fabulous and magical, so I set out to achieve a workflow using git worktrees to have the best of both worlds: **fast iteration during development** and **clean reproducibility for batch processing**.

| Context                    | State                  | Purpose                                  | Data Access                    |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Main Worktree              | Active development         | Trying new analyses, debugging, exploration  | Shared annex symlinks              |
| `runs` Worktree            | Frozen, stable state       | Batch processing, reproducible execution     | Shared annex symlinks              |

Now that I've introduced the most important concepts and the objective, I'll leave you alone with the report of the journey that I jotted down along the process with almost no post-hoc modification. As original as it can be ;) Enjoy!

### **For the impatient**: Here is where the fun starts

│   └── 04_dataframes/
└── ...
```
The active work in my project happens in the *derived/L5b* subdataset that consumes raw data as inputs and produces multiple intermediate outputs, e.g. *01_suite2p* ... *04_dataframes*. The subdataset *code* is a pure git repo and I use [Jujutsu](https://docs.jj-vcs.dev/latest/) for active development. I encountered *jj* the same time as I heard of the worktrees (check out [Lorenz's talk on *Radicle* and his experience with *Jujutsu*](https://youtu.be/kyjNewoGK3k?si=R4QRiEmvoZxFpX3U*)) and fell in love instantly (read more [here](https://gin.g-node.org/jwu/Meng_Psychedelics/wiki/Unlocking+martial+magic+with+Datalad+and+Jujutsu)). After a rather nerve-wracking experience of mixing `datalad` with `jj` - it was like Schrödinger's cat, everything was simultaneously staged and unstaged 😱 - I restrict `jj` usage to *code*, and continue using `datalad` for managing all subdatasets with annexed content, orchestrating across nested datasets as a whole, and for capturing provenance of all derived data and figures with the [datalad (containers-)](https://docs.datalad.org/projects/container/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-containers-run.html) [run](https://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-run.html#datalad-run) command.

### Neither ready to go big nor go home: worktrees instead of clones
Usually, I craft one [`datalad run`](https://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/generated/man/datalad-run.html) command, test it, and then write a bash script to run it for multiple subjects and experiments. Here is when it becomes painful: once it's running you can't carry on working, because any modification will interrupt the next `datalad run` command. Ideally, I can run things in an isolated environment that is clean and stays untouched until the job finishes. [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) come in handy, because they essentially access the same annexed content (so no time wasted in getting content for another clone), but live in a different directory on the disk. Worktrees share the annex and repo history, but not the state the repo is in. This allows me to checkout different branches simultaneously since they live on different worktrees.

Since at the moment there is no DataLad helper command to create a collection of nested worktrees (described in [this issue](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/7764)) for each subdataset, I directly use `git worktree add` command to create a worktree for each subdataset inside *derived/L5b*:

```bash
# add a worktree on a new branch with the name `runs` for the superds
M/d/L5b (master)> git worktree add /mnt/Data/L5b-runs -b runs
Preparing worktree (new branch `runs`)
HEAD is now at fde26554f [DATALAD RUNCMD] plot rois, traces and F displots for mouse J, Lisuride

# repeat for each subdataset
M/d/L5b (master)> cd inputs/L5b_bpod
M/d/L/i/L5b_bpod (master)> git worktree add /mnt/Data/L5b-runs/inputs/L5b_bpod -b runs
Preparing worktree (new branch `runs`)
HEAD is now at e32a9bbf2c [DATALAD RUNCMD] Rename bpod files of mouse J, LSD with the missing date.

M/d/L/i/L5b_bpod (master)> cd ../L5b_2p
M/d/L/i/L5b_2p (master)> git worktree add /mnt/Data/L5b-runs/inputs/L5b_2p -b runs
Preparing worktree (new branch `runs`)
HEAD is now at 3bd0b284b2 rename interrupted recording

M/d/L/i/L5b_2p (master)> cd ../../code
M/d/L/code> git worktree add /mnt/Data/L5b-runs/code runs # here I skip -b because the branch already exists
Preparing worktree (checking out `runs`)
HEAD is now at ef5dafb generate_plots: plot rois, traces, and F displots
```

The branch `runs` in `code/` has already been created, when I got ready with the code:
```bash
# the new datalad run command is ready
M/d/L/code> git switch -c runs
Switched to a new branch `runs`

# `runs` points to the commit ef5dafb4: generate_plots

```
For all perspective jj users, having the `empty` change on top of the target commit is a necessary condition for a clean working tree and thus for datalad run to happen.

So the plan is to park the worktree `runs` at this clean state on top of the commit `ef5dafb4`, run the script *generate_plots.py* on multiple subjects and experiments, while continuing developing on dirty branches. Let's see if that works out!

In the newly created worktree `runs`, I verify that it is in the right state that records the successful `datalad run` command:
```bash
# in worktree `runs`
/m/D/L5b-runs (runs)> git log --oneline
fde26554f (HEAD -> runs, master) [DATALAD RUNCMD] plot rois, traces and F displots for mouse J, Lisuride
```

Nice, I will first attempt a rerun! Oh wait, not so fast, I need to set up my [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) using a wonderful and fast [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) tool. So I go:
```bash
cd code
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
cd ..
```

Now, RERUN!
```bash

```
It completes without creating a new commit - the outputs are byte-for-byte identical to the previous run. This is where the magic happens: I'm running from a completely different directory, yet I don't need to `datalad get` anything or `datalad save` results. The annex's clever symlinks make the same data available in both worktrees, eliminating redundancy entirely! 🎩✨

Now it's time to write that bash script, and to test how going forth and back between worktrees works. To not mix things up, I will never develop in the worktree `runs`, but only update it with what ever has been developed and become available on 'master' - well, actually we don't care about branches in jj's universe but anyway you get the gist.

```
Let's update that branch and sew the `HEAD` back to `runs`. There are multiple ways to do that, including plain `git` commands, but since I'm exploring Jujutsu's universe at the moment, I go:
```bash
/M/d/L/code [2]> jj bookmark set runs -r 'git_head()'
Moved 1 bookmarks to yknyuprl 84312427 runs* | update README.md

# now both `runs` and 'git_head()' point to the right commit

```

Back in worktree `runs`, I confirm the branch has been updated for *code* and the superdataset also registers the update:
```bash
# in worktree `runs`
/m/D/L/code (runs)> git log --oneline
8431242 (HEAD -> runs, refs/jj/keep/843124271281fc8e8a7a3ceff202a4fa6f0a08a8) update README.md

/m/D/L/code (runs)> cd ..

# in the superds of the same worktree
m/D/L5b-runs (runs)> datalad status
 modified: code (dataset) # need to save this modification
```
Should I also save this update in my main worktree? No, I will only save it in this worktree and then update the main worktree when the plots are ready! (What's datalad's behavior with branches anyway?)

### Seasoning with a pinch of Jujutsu magic
I'm almost ready to go, except that I have to amend another modification to the bash script. Out of curiosity I decide to use `jj squash` to add this modification to the previous change instead of creating a new commit. I observe that the commit ID changes, and that `runs` still points to the correct commit:
```bash
# in main worktree
/M/d/L/code> jj squash --into turmruqs
Rebased 1 descendant commits
Working copy  (@) now at: oqwzryko 8af9e583 (empty) (no description set)
Parent commit (@-)      : yknyuprl 25eff5ce runs | update README.md

# the commit ID associated with the change ID 'turmruqs' has changed from '08065905' to '42c0112b'
/M/d/L/code> jj log

```
How does this change of history affect the other worktree?
```bash
# in worktree `runs`
/m/D/L/code (runs)> git log --oneline
25eff5c (HEAD -> runs, refs/jj/keep/25eff5cef05040cd0d54e4cfb36107c8f7708d0b) update README.md
42c0112 (refs/jj/keep/42c0112b40b45d58ce5d86bb57061ab5d0387d82) add bash script to run generate_plots.py
ef5dafb (refs/jj/keep/ef5dafb4ac4b7e9e2c6854cff726bede0c47ac53, master) generate_plots: plot rois, traces, and F displots
```
That's fantastic! I sneaked in a new modification without running any `datalad save` command and get the clean worktree for free! Hurrraaayy!!! But wait, git and datalad does detect the change:
```bash
# still in worktree `runs`
/m/D/L/code (runs)> datalad status
 modified: pipelines/run_generate_plots.sh (file) # <- that's the batch-processing script

/m/D/L/code (runs)> git status
On branch runs
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   pipelines/run_generate_plots.sh
```
It is because the file has in fact changed due to the `jj squash` operation. I changed the history and there is a mismatch with the presence. All I need to do is to reset it to `runs` with `git reset --hard runs`.

### The trade-off between efficiency and reproducibility: You win some you loose some

The script fails, and I try to rerun this one command that worked earlier, it fails as well:
```bash

What happened? - Apparently, I've lost the *.venv* directory during the hard reset which causes `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'process2p'`. määäh! This actually speaks for the use of a container. The problem with the container is that I have to rebuild it every time I update my code ... annoying! (I learned that this statement might not be technically true, but since I'm only half-educated on this topic, I will leave it as it is for now.) I guess that's the trade-off between efficiency and reproducibility. To illustrate this 'highly complex' dilemma with Deepseek's smart-ass comment in a graph:
```
        Fast Iteration ←──────────→ Reproducibility
              ↑                          ↑
          Convenience           Containerized Certainty
```
The attentive reader might now also want to blame my decision to rewrite the history instead of creating a new commit which would have avoided the `git reset` operation and the loss of the uv environment. I guess also here there is a trade-off between maintaining a clean history and keeping development momentum:
```
         Clean History ←──────────→ Development Flow
              ↑                          ↑
         Atomic Commits             Rapid Iteration
```

For now I will just repeat the `uv sync` operation from above and add this code snippet to all my future scripts:
```bash
# Always ensure .venv exists
if [ ! -f "code/.venv/bin/python" ]; then
    echo "WARNING: .venv missing! Recreating..."
    cd code
    uv sync
    source .venv/bin/activate.fish
    cd ..
fi
```

### Run, Datalad, Run!

Meanwhile, the script has finished and left me with a set of successful `[DATALAD RUNCMD]` and an ocean of plots that I can swim in for the next few days :D Let's push the results back to the main worktree! In my main worktree, I simply run `git merge runs`, and bahm, all the plots are there!
```bash
# back in the main worktree

I'm very happy! :D Also, meanwhile I did update my code repo with the code snippet above:
```bash
# still in the main worktree
/M/d/L/code> jj log

```
The change `kxqpponr` has been created in the main worktree during the plotting that happened in the `runs` worktree on top of the `empty` change from where I sent off the plotting jobs. Now I can simply clean up with `jj abandon`.
```bash
/M/d/L/code> jj abandon oq

Beaauuutiful!

### **Conclude:** All the magic in a nutshell
That was a very pleasant experience and quite a breakthrough in my personal data management journey. Between **daily development chaos** and **production-ready reproducibility** I found the sweetspot for a data analysis workflow that costs absolutely nothing in terms of time and disk space.

The beauty of this approach is its simplicity and efficiency:

- No data duplication: Worktrees share annexed files, so you don't need to `datalad get` everything again
- Parallel workflows: Develop in main worktree with Jujutsu or Git, process in clean worktree with DataLad
- Seamless integration: Merge results back with a simple `git merge`
- Low overhead: Environment setup happens once, then persists for all runs (unless you are enthusiastic time-traveler like me :P)

This isn't a replacement for full reproducibility frameworks - for final publication runs, I still reach for containers and fully specified environments, and adapt something like [the fairly big processing workflow](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/fairly-big-processing-workflow). But for the 90% of my work that happens between initial exploration and final publication, this workflow hits the perfect balance.

Here is the destilled recipe for the workflow:
1. Create a nested git worktree for your nested dataset on a new branch, here `runs`
2. Set up the computational environment for this worktree
3. Craft and test the `datalad run` command invocation
4. Write a script that executes the datalad run command over multiple instances, here over subjects and experiments
5. Make the update available on the branch/worktree `runs`
6. Run the script in the worktree `runs`
7. Merge the results into the main worktree
8. Repeat 3-7 for the next iteration

Happy analyzing! 🧠
